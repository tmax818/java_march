# [Cafe Java](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/315/9299/62839)

- Create [CafeJava.java](CafeJava.java)

- [ ] Create 3 more drink price variables, for drip coffee, latte and cappuccino following the camel case naming convention.

- [ ] Create 3 more customer variables for Sam, Jimmy and Noah, following the same variable naming convention in the example.

- [ ] Create the order status flag (true/false) for each customer, following the variable naming convention in the example.

- [ ] For the next tasks, we will be simulating customer interactions, printing messages to the screen, based on scenarios. Cindhuri ordered a coffee. Print to the console the correct status message, based on her order status.

- [ ] Noah ordered a cappuccino. Use an if statement to check the status of his order and print the correct status message. If it is ready, also print the message to display the total. Note: Outcomes may be different depending on what you assigned as the status.

- [ ] Sam just ordered 2 lattes, print the message to display their total. Next, use an if statement to print the appropriate order status message. Change the isReady flag value from true to false or vice versa in order to test your control logic (if-statement).

- [ ] Jimmy just realized he was charged for a coffee but had ordered a latte. Print the total message with the new calculated total (what he owes) to make up the difference.

- [ ] Try changing the price values for each drink and isReady flags (booleans), to test if all of your logic works, even when prices and statuses are changed.
